- Brand Perspective
- Perspective is how we see and understand things. A brandâ€™s idea is its unique way of looking at the world, like Volvo focusing on safety or Coca-Cola on happiness. Design turns this idea into pictures or visuals that people can understand and feel.
-Filtering the Important
-Art and stories take away extra details to show only what matters most. Design does the same, focusing on the main idea to create something clear and simple that speaks to people.
